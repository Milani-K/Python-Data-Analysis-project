Car Production Data Analysis Report

This project analyzes a dataset of car production, providing insights into the number of cars produced by year.
It includes visualizations and summary statistics to better understand trends in the automotive industry.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is car_data.csv, which should contain information about various car models, including their production year and other specifications.

Expected Columns
year: The year the car was produced.
Additional columns such as make, model, city_mpg, combination_mpg, cylinders, displacement, drive, fuel_type, and transmission.
Usage
Ensure you have the dataset (car_data.csv) in the same directory as your script.
Run the script to load the data, check for missing values, duplicate rows, and view summary statistics.
The script generates a line plot showing the number of cars produced each year, along with the mean of various attributes displayed on the side.
bash
Copy code
python your_script.py
Analysis Steps
Loading Data: The script loads the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Data Inspection: It checks for missing values, duplicates, and data types.
Summary Statistics: The script computes and prints summary statistics for the dataset.
Visualization: A line plot is created to visualize car production trends over the years.
Results
The output includes:

A printed summary of missing values and duplicates.
Summary statistics for numeric columns.
A line graph showing the number of cars produced each year, with the average of various attributes annotated beside the plot.
